        <h1>The Power of Ragebait</h1>
        <p> For those of you who don’t know what ragebaiting is, ragebaiting is pretty much modern day trolling, where you intentionally provoke someone in order to get a reaction. This post isn’t here to argue that ragebaiting is good, but the concept of ragebaiting has helped me a lot, not in the way you might think.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Around a year to two years ago, I used to get really frustrated or sometimes even mad when I played team based FPS games like VALORANT. Especially when I played ranked, I would rage quit when I saw my teammates making horrible plays, whiffing on easy enemies, or selling rounds that were supposed to be guaranteed. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p> Nowadays, I just think of it as an attempt to ragebait me. Funnily enough, most of the time it actually is an attempt to ragebait me. Ragebaiting becoming so prevalent has, in a way, led me to not give in to my frustration or anger. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p> As silly as this may sound, I began to apply the idea of ragebait to other areas of my life as well. If I ran into any unfortunate circumstance out of my control, I categorized it as ragebait. If a fly was incessantly pestering me, I would consider it ragebait. If I tripped and fell randomly, I would consider it ragebait from the universe. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p> This isn’t to say you should just accept every bad thing that happens in your life and not think about what caused it. However, if there’s something truly out of your control, it’s best to think of it just as ragebait and move on. </p>
